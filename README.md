LISA: Latent Invariant Space AdaptationA Dual-Timescale Framework for Robust Adaptive Control"Robust system performance is not merely a function of error minimization, but rather the result of maintaining a low-dimensional attracting manifold." — LISA Technical Report 1OverviewLISA is a control-theoretic architecture designed for high-dimensional, non-stationary environments2222. Unlike standard deep learning, which relies on the static optimization of fixed architectures 3, LISA models the agent as a singularly perturbed dynamical system4444. It explicitly decouples fast inference dynamics from slow structural adaptation dynamics5.Mathematical FormulationThe system evolves on two distinct, mathematically separated timescales $(t, \tau)$6:$$\dot{z} = f(z, u, \Theta) \quad \text{(Fast State Dynamics)}$$$$\dot{\Theta} = \epsilon g(z, u, \Theta) \quad \text{(Slow Structural Dynamics)}$$The Invariance ConditionAdaptation is driven by the violation of the Lyapunov Energy function $V(z, \Theta)$7777. The structural update law is derived as a steepest descent on the system's energy landscape8888:$$\dot{\Theta} = -\Gamma \phi(z,u)\eta^{T}$$This ensures that the manifold reconstruction error $\eta \to 0$ asymptotically, providing a provable stability margin even during distribution drift9999.Key FeaturesDual-Timescale Separation: Explicit modeling of the $\epsilon$ perturbation parameter allows for rigorous stability analysis10101010.Lyapunov-Driven Updates: Structural plasticity is mathematically guaranteed to reduce system energy, replacing heuristic learning rates with stability guarantees11.Continuous Adaptation: There are no "epochs" or "batches"; learning is a parallel, continuous-time flow12.CitationIf you use this codebase, please cite the technical report:Latent Invariant Space Adaptation (LISA): A Dual-Timescale Framework for Robust Adaptive Control, December 202513.
